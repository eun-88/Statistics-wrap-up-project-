Project Overview: Online Retail Data Analysis

Statistical Comparison: Compared population and sample (n=1000) of TotalPrice to validate the Central Limit Theorem.

Hypothesis Testing: Performed Independent T-tests on the top two purchasing countries to analyze mean differences while evaluating Type I & II errors.

Distribution Analysis: Analyzed UnitPrice variances between weekdays and weekends using descriptive statistics and visualized distributions via Boxplots and Histograms.

Demand Forecasting: Developed a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict Quantity based on price, country, and temporal features (Day/Month).

Return Prediction: Built a Logistic Regression classifier to predict IsReturn status, evaluating performance through a Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
